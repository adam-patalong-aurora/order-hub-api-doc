# Introduction
Orders are placed based on the received configurator, which must be implemented in your store. It is crucial to create the correct configuration. Particular attention should be paid to the correct transfer of component IDs. Then you send the order containing individual configurations to the appropriate API, and OrderHub processes it. To submit a query correctly, you must always include your [authorization data](../authorization) in the header. In this tab you will find detailed information about [how to create](./create) and [send](./create#sending-the-order) order configurations to OrderHub and how to edit them.
