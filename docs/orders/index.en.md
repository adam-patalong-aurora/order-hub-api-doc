# Introduction
Orders are placed and edited based on the configurator. Detailed information about it can be found [here](../configurator). Particular attention should be paid to the correct transfer of component IDs. Then you send the order containing individual configurations to the appropriate API, and OrderHub processes it. To submit a query correctly, you must always include your [authorization data](../authorization) in the header. In this tab you will find detailed information about [how to create](./create) and [send](./create#sending-the-order) order configurations to OrderHub and how to [edit](./update) them.
